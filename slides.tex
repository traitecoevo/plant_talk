% NOTES:
% 1. Consider species as vectors of traits
% 2. Fitness is the expected number of offspring per individual, but
%    varies depending on the number and types of other individuals.
% 3. Throw in a bunch of seeds, and see how many seeds each seed
%    produces.  Consider traits to be fixed through this part.  This
%    is our "ecological black box"

% NOTES:
% 1. A seed is the natural place to census how types are doing.
% 2. Seeds are discrete things, and we can count them up.
% 3. A plant is simply a seeds way of making more seeds, and we can
%    largely ignore them when considering how species are doing (how
%    important is a large plant that will never reproduce).
% 4. However, they are fairly important ecologically...
% 5. To produce a new seed, the seed must
%    - germinate
%    - grow to maturity (and bigger plants make more seed)
%    - have enough spare energy to go into reproduction
% 6. So most of the ecology will focus on the plant.
% 7. But this cycle really is all that is in the black box.

% NOTES:
% 1. *A plant* has a size (height, allometric scaling for
%    other sizes), probability of dying and a rate of seed production.
% 2. All these rates are functions of *total carbon assimilation*,
%    which is a function of the plant's leaf area distribution (canopy
%    shape) and the light environment.
% 3. The carbon fixed is then assigned to maintenance, growth and
%    reproduction.  Your probability of mortality depends inversely on
%    the amount of photosynthesis you do.
% 4. (The key ingredient is how much carbon you fix; we consider light
%    primarily as the limiting resource)

% NOTES:
% The light environment is derived by summing over all the leaf
% area distributions of all individuals -- it also varies over time
% and emerges from the model.  It provides a strong feedback between
% all individuals in the model.
%
% [Plants grow in the context of a forest; how much light you get
% depends on who grows around you and how big they are; but that
% depends on who grows around those plants, and so on.  This is the
% key feedback]
